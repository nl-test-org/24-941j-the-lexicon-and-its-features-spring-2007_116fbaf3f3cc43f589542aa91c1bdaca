Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Instructor approval.

### Supplementary Sessions

Background material in phonology and possibly phonetics and psycholinguistics of lexical access will be presented for those who are interested (especially students lacking a background in these fields) in separate sessions to precede the relevant lectures.

Course Requirements
-------------------

All students enrolled in the course are required to:

*   Do the readings.
*   Actively participate in class.
*   Submit a research paper, presented in one of the last two sessions and written up.

We encourage inter-disciplinary teams of students doing joint work. We will set aside some time early in the term to discuss with the class the logistics of such collaboration.
